### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used more of CSS Flexbox, although not a lot but tnough to practice with.


### Continued development

For my future projects, I would like to use more of CSS Grid as I believe it would help me have a better understanding of how it works.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - i forgot the syntax for transitions so i looked it up on w#schools.
